# Gesture recognition - training the model

To continue building the neural network that will recognise gestures, the mathemathics as discussed in a [previous section](../chapter3/training.md) will be implemented in Python. Then the aquired data from the proximity sensor will be used to train the network, and finally, the trained weights will be used to run the model on the TinySpark development kit.

# TinySpark

The TinySpark project is created by J Siderius, as part of the Bachelor Thesis for Creative Technology in 2023.

The projects aim is to enable everyone, from hobbyist, maker, student to professor, to understand (Tiny) Machine Learning in a simple and intuitive way. Furthermore, by providing many sample projects, users should be able to integrate meaningful TinyML applications into their own projects and needs.

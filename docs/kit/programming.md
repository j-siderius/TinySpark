# Programming the TinyML Development kit

The TinyML Development kit uses the [MicroPython] programming language. This is fork of the popular Python 3 programming language, which brings simple to understand syntax of Python to microcontroller such as our TinyML Development kit.

To program our Development kit, first we connect to it using the USB-C to USB-A cable. The kit should be recognized as a new device (COM in Windows, dev/tty in Mac OSX or Linux). We will use the [Code with Mu] programming IDE, because it offers simple interfacing with the TinyML Development kit, and gives helpful programming prompts for MicroPython.

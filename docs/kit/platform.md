# TinySpark platform

This page gives a quick overview of the the TinySpark platform (this webpage), how it functions, how to use it and where to find help if you need it.

---

The TinySpark platform is divided into several chapters:

- [Chapter 1: Introduction to neurons]
- [Chapter 2: Networks and structures]
- [Chapter 3: Training networks]
- [Chapter 4: Large models and Input shaping]
- [Chapter 5: Datatypes and more Projects]

<!-- sources -->
[Chapter 1: Introduction to neurons]:../chapter1/introduction.md
[Chapter 2: Networks and structures]:../chapter2/introduction.md
[Chapter 3: Training networks]:../index.md
[Chapter 4: Large models and Input shaping]:../index.md
[Chapter 5: Datatypes and more Projects]:../index.md

These chapters will introduce various concepts within (Tiny) Machine Learning in an engaging, interactive and project-based way. They can be accessed by clicking on the chapters here, or on the navigation bar at the top of the page.

The TinySpark platform uses several methods to teach, for example using textual explanation, formulas, code snippets and interactive applications.

Code snippets will be introduced in the following manner:

[![Open In Colab](../assets/images/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AoRa8GUn_qJEkL_W6yFm9ECDFSHOD0yD)

```python title="test_code.py"
# This is some Python code
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b

print(c)

=> 3
```

The source code will be displayed on the page, with the option to open the code in [Google Colaboratory], a online code environment for Python notebooks. Any Python code that can be run on a PC (so no TinyML Development Kit code) will be available for testing and playing around on Colab; just click the link and a new notebook will open. If you want to interact this with the code, you need a Google account.

Interactive applications will be shown as follows:

<!-- TODO: add example interactive element -->

To interact, click on the interactive window and start changing values, clicking on points etc. The animation will change and explain concepts in a tangible way.

In the next section, the TinyML Development Kit will be introduced.
